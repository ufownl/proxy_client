This branch adds to the master branch the capability of en/decrypting the message forwarded between the local client and the remote server. The cryptographic algorithm used is Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) working at the Cipher Feedback (CFB) mode. OpenSSLâ€™s implementation of the algorithm is used. Consequently, this branch has an additional dependency on the OpenSSL library.

The value of the "key_src" entry in the config file specifies the key for AES. If the value is empty or the entire "key_src" entry is not present in the config file, no encryption will be performed.
